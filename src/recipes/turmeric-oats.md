Heat the oil in the pan and add the mustard and cumin seeds.

When the seeds start sizzling and popping, add the crushed garlic and diced
onion and stirr around to soften.

Then add the chilli flakes, the chopped tomatoes, and the green bell pepper and
fry this until the tomatoes have gone nice and mushy. Then add the turmeric and
stirr this in.

Next, add the oats and 400ml of water and salt to taste. Now wait for the
mixture to thicken and take on the consistency you like, feel free to add water
a few tablespoons at a time if you think it needs to cook for longer.
