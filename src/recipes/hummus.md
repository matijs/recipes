## Preparation

Place the chickpeas in a bowl with plenty of water and add about 3 heaped tea
spoons of salt. Soak overnight in the fridge.

The next day poor off the water and rinse the chickpeas.

Bring the chickpeas, the cloves of garlic and the bay leaf to the boil in about
1l of water. Do not add any extra salt. Let this simmer for about an hour.
Then pour off the water, but save it, it's needed in the next step.

Remove the bay leaf and put the chickpeas and garlic in a food processor. Add a
few table spoons of tahini and enough of the chickpea water for the food processor 
to do its thing. You can add water, you can't take it out. Add a couple of grinds 
of fresh black pepper and blend to a creamy mixture.
